\maketitle
We begin with \textcite{Shotton1989}. We can also cite this work in
parenthesis, like this: \parencite{Shotton1989}.
A three-author paper \parencite[e.g.,][]{Lassen2006} lists all
three authors for the first citation, then only the first author
on all subsequent citations \parencite{Lassen2006}.
Note the use of five heading levels throughout this demonstration
Method section.
\section{Method}
\subsection{Participants}
We had a lot of people in this study.
\subsection{Materials}
Several materials were used for this project. Some of them were
already created for prior research.
We used an instrument that we found to be highly successful.
\paragraph{Reliability}
The reliability of this instrument is extraordinary.
\paragraph{Validity}
We now discuss the validity of our instrument.
\subparagraph{Face validity} The face validity is exceptionally
strong. Everyone should be impressed.
\subparagraph{Construct validity} Also very strong.
\subsection{Design}
This section describes the study’s design.
\subsection{Procedure}
The procedure was fairly straightforward, yet required
attention to detail.
\section{Results}
Table \ref{tab:ComplexTable} contains some sample data. Our
statistical prowess in analyzing these data is unmatched.
